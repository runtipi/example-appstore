## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

### Initial Setup
1. After installation, access Nextcloud via your configured domain/IP on port 443 (HTTPS)
2. Follow the setup wizard to create your administrator account
3. Configure your database (SQLite is fine for small installations, PostgreSQL/MySQL recommended for larger deployments)
4. Start uploading and syncing your files!

### Security Considerations
- This Nextcloud instance uses HTTPS by default with a self-signed certificate
- For production use, configure proper SSL certificates via reverse proxy
- Configure trusted domains in Nextcloud settings
- Enable two-factor authentication for all users
- Regular security updates are recommended

### Performance Tips
- Use external database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for better performance with multiple users
- Configure Redis for file locking and caching
- Consider using object storage for large deployments
